# XSS
## What is XSS?
cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious code into a web application. This code can then be executed by users of the application, potentially stealing their data or compromising their accounts.
#### There are three main types of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks:
* Reflected XSS: This occurs when an attacker tricks a victim into visiting a malicious URL that contains the attacker's code. The code is then reflected back to the victim's browser by the vulnerable web application, allowing it to be executed on the victim's computer.
* Stored XSS: This happens when an attacker injects malicious code into a vulnerable web application, such as through user input fields or comment sections. When other users visit the application, their browsers execute the stored code without their knowledge or consent.
* DOM-based XSS: This involves manipulating dynamic content within a web page using JavaScript APIs like document object model (DOM) or XMLHttpRequest (XHR). By exploiting these APIs, an attacker can inject malicious code into a page and have it executed in victims' browsers.
### Example of an XSS Attack
A simple example of a reflected XSS attack is when an attacker sends a user a link to a trusted website but with a malicious script embedded in the URL. For instance:
* http://example.com/search?q=<script>alert('XSS')</script>
## How to Detect XSS
To detect cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, you can use the following steps:
* Identify potential entry points for user input, such as form fields, URL parameters, and cookies.
* Sanitize or validate all user input before using it in dynamic content like HTML or JavaScript. This involves removing any potentially dangerous characters or encoding special characters to prevent them from being interpreted as code by the browser.
* Use HTTP response headers like Content-Security-Policy (CSP) to restrict the types of content that can be loaded on a page and prevent XSS attacks from executing malicious code in victims' browsers.
## Impact of XSS 
The consequences of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks can vary depending on the type of attack and the vulnerable web application. However, some common effects include:
* Stealing sensitive information: XSS attacks can be used to steal user credentials, financial information, and other personal data by injecting malicious code into a login form or other sensitive pages.
* Modifying content: Attackers can use XSS to modify the content displayed on a page, such as changing product prices or altering user reviews to spread false information or manipulate public opinion.
* Taking over accounts: By injecting malicious code into a login form, an attacker can hijack users' accounts without their knowledge or consent. This allows them to access sensitive data and perform actions under the victim's identity.
## How to prevent XSS
To prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, you can follow these best practices:
* Sanitize or validate all user input before using it in dynamic content like HTML or JavaScript. This involves removing any potentially dangerous characters or encoding special characters to prevent them from being interpreted as code by the browser.
* Use HTTP response headers like Content-Security-Policy (CSP) to restrict the types of content that can be loaded on a page and prevent XSS attacks from executing malicious code in victims' browsers.
